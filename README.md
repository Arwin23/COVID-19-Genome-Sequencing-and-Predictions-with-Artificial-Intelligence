# COVID-19-Genome-Sequencing-and-Predictions-with-Artificial-Intelligence
Genome sequencing with deep learning and other artificial intelligence methods.

This code has been successfully implemented with Spyder(Python 3.7) in Windows 10 OS.

The primary goal of this code is to predict the evolution of COVID-19, to aid in treatments and vaccines.

## Instructions

1. Run `Imports_AI_Genome.py` and `Encoding-Genome-Functions.py` for imports and functions. 

2. COVID-19 genome sequences can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jamzing/sars-coronavirus-accession/tasks?taskId=458).
